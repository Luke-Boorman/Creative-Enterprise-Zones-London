Understanding the changing ecology of Londonâ€™s creative economy through data. 

Project Aims: 

1. Evaluate the economic impact of Creative Enterprise Zones in London.

2. Compare performance metrics across different CEZs and with non-CEZ creative areas.

3. Identify trends in job creation, business growth, and sector-specific developments within these creative hubs.

4. Provide insights to inform policy decisions and support strategies for fostering creative industries in London and other urban areas.

By analyzing these data, local and national government will be able to develop a deeper understanding of the creative economy's dynamics within London's designated Creative Enterprise Zones and better understand their contribution to the city's overall economic landscape.
